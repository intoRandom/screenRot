# screenRot – Much More Than a Prank

`screenRot` is a small educational project that uses humor as a gateway to critical thinking in cybersecurity. Through a PowerShell script that simulates a screen failure, we aim to demonstrate how easy it is to run code without verifying its origin.

This project was developed by [intoRandom](https://intorandom.com) and is aimed at the general public, with the goal of promoting digital awareness and teaching key concepts such as **RCE (Remote Code Execution)**, system privileges, dangerous file types, and more.

## 🚨 Warning

Although this script is harmless and makes no permanent changes, it simulates behaviors commonly found in real attacks. You should never run scripts from untrusted sources or without understanding how they work.

## 📂 What Does the Script Do?

- Downloads **an image** (broken screen) and **a sound**.
- Schedules a task to run at the next login.
- Displays the image and plays the sound.
- Deletes all downloaded files after execution.
- Works only on **Windows** and requires no installation.
